## This Open Source Project was Selected for Kharagpur Winter of Code by IIT Kharagpur with me being the Mentor and Project Maintainer of OTES.

## ⭕⭕Problem Statement-
Emergencies and disasters impact population's health. Public health plays a critical role in working with health and non-health sectors responsible for preparing for and responding to emergencies. In emergencies, large number of people may require medical attention. Health care systems may be over-stretched, and public order may be threatened. Hence, we want software solution such that social media can be used in public health emeergency response. Such tool/page/plugin should have the below capabilities.
1) Alarm message during Emergencies.
2) Providing precautionary steps to be taken during emergency/disorders.
3) Help in finding nearby available healthcare systems.
4) Providing First aid/primary steps to be taken/provided to patients, in case of emergencies/diasters.

### ✔Organisation-
Ministry of Health and Family Welfare
### ✔Category-
Software solution
### ✔Domain Bucket-
Healthcare and Biomedical Devices

🔶Scope of solution for future: 
1. Using ML model, minmum distance determination from receiver with confirmation with atleast three.
2. Blackbox facility
3. Bluetooth tethering with cars.

## 💥⭕How to contribute?
### 1. 👇🏻Star and Fork this Repository
###### You can star ⭐ and fork 🍽️ this repository on GitHub by navigating at the top of this repository.


###### GitHub repository URLs will reference both the username associated with the owner of the repository, as well as the repository name.


###### When you’re on the main page for the repository, you’ll see a button to "Star" and “Fork” the repository on your upper right-hand side of the page, underneath your user icon.

### 2. 👇🏻Clone the Repository

###### To make your own local copy of the repository you would like to contribute to, let’s first open up a terminal window.

###### We’ll use the `git clone`  command along with the URL that points to your fork of the repository.

### 3. 👇🏻Update Local Repository

###### While working on a project alongside other contributors, it is important for you to keep your local repository up-to-date with the project as you don’t want to make a pull request for code that will cause conflicts. To keep your local copy of the code base updated, you’ll need to sync changes.

###### We’ll first go over configuring a remote for the fork, then syncing the fork.

### 4. 👇🏻Sync the Fork

###### Once you have configured a remote that references the upstream and original repository on GitHub, you are ready to sync your fork of the repository to keep it up-to-date.
###### To sync your fork, from the directory of your local repository in a terminal window, you’ll have to use the // git fetch // command to fetch the branches along with their respective commits from the upstream repository. Since you used the shortname “upstream” to refer to the upstream repository, you’ll have to pass that to the command:

##### ` git fetch upstream `

###### Switch to the local master branch of our repository:

##### ` git checkout master `

###### Now merge any changes that were made in the original repository’s master branch, that you will access through your local upstream/master branch, with your local master branch:

##### ` git merge upstream/master `

### 5. 👇🏻Create Pull Request

###### At this point, you are ready to make a pull request to the original repository.

###### Now navigate to your forked repository, and press the “New pull request” button on your left-hand side of the page.

## Interesting? Star⭐ this Repo😊

# Happy Learning💯 Happy Developing👍
